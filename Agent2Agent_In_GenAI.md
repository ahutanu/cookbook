# Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol in GenAI: Enabling Multi-Agent AI in Enterprise Automation

Generative AI is moving beyond single-model applications into networks of specialized agents that collaborate to automate complex tasks. The open **Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol** standardizes how these AI agents find each other, share work, and combine outputs. In enterprise settings — from customer support and onboarding to supply chains and IT operations — A2A promises to break down silos between systems and vendors, letting agents built on any platform work together seamlessly. By using familiar web technologies under the hood (HTTP, JSON, streaming) and adding features for security and long-running workflows, A2A makes multi-agent automation **simple to integrate and enterprise-ready**. As one analyst notes, “AI agents … must interact with multiple systems, gather and process data asynchronously, and operate reliably at scale” – essentially treating them like microservices with brains. A2A provides the common language for these “agents with brains” to communicate and collaborate across the enterprise.

## What is A2A and How It Works

The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol is an **open, vendor-neutral standard** designed so AI agents (often opaque black boxes) can interoperate. Instead of each pair of agents needing custom integration, A2A defines a shared format and process for agent conversations. Under A2A, each agent publishes an **Agent Card** (a small JSON profile) describing its identity, capabilities, and endpoint URL. Other agents can discover available agents by reading these cards. When one agent (the “client”) needs help with a task, it finds a suitable “remote” agent and sends a **task message** to it. All communication happens over secure HTTP using **JSON-RPC 2.0** calls.

In practice, an A2A message exchange looks like a client agent calling a remote agent’s API. The client invokes methods like `tasks/send` (to start or continue a task) or `tasks/sendSubscribe` (to begin streaming updates). For example, the client might send:

```json
POST https://agent.example.com/a2a/v1/jsonrpc
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "tasks/send",
  "params": {
    "id": "task-123",
    "message": {
      "parts": [
        {"contentType": "text/plain", "text": "Find hotels in Paris"}
      ]
    }
  },
  "id": 42
}
```

The remote agent processes the request, performs its work (e.g. runs a booking search), and returns results in a structured **Task** object. The A2A spec explicitly supports *long-running tasks* and asynchronous updates: agents can stream back intermediate status or artifacts (like confirmation documents) via Server-Sent Events, and clients can also poll or receive push notifications. This allows the agents to handle workflows that take minutes or hours (or even involve human steps) without losing context.

Key features of A2A include:

* **Standard transport and format:** All messages use HTTP(S) with JSON-RPC 2.0. This means agents just need a normal web server interface, and can plug into enterprise networks without special middleware.
* **Agent discovery:** Agents advertise their capabilities via **Agent Cards** – JSON files that include fields like `name`, `url`, and supported `skills`. Other agents read these cards to find who can do what.
* **Task and state management:** A2A defines a `Task` object with a lifecycle. A client agent creates a new task (or resumes one) by calling `tasks/send`. The remote agent works on it and replies. If the task is ongoing, the agents exchange `TaskStatusUpdate` messages until it completes. The final result is returned as an “artifact” (e.g. a JSON result or file). Agents can also request `tasks/get` or `tasks/cancel`.
* **Rich content exchange:** Messages can carry not just text but forms, JSON data, images or other media. Each message is composed of “parts” (with specified content types) so agents negotiate formats dynamically. For example, one agent might send a form (JSON) for the user to fill, while another returns an image chart as the result. The protocol is **modality-agnostic**, so it supports text, structured data, files, and even streaming audio/video.
* **Security and enterprise readiness:** A2A is built with corporate environments in mind. It requires HTTPS, supports OAuth or mutual TLS for authentication, and includes auditing. For instance, Microsoft notes that every A2A call “travels through enterprise-grade safeguards: Microsoft Entra, mutual TLS, Azure AI Content Safety, and full audit logs”. In short, agents talk over the secure network stacks enterprises already use, and all agent actions are logged for compliance.

By combining these elements, A2A lets agents interact as equals: a client agent can send data or questions to a remote agent, get back structured replies or ask for further input, and coordinate the entire task in a standard, observable way. Because it uses familiar protocols, developers can implement A2A on top of any stack (REST frameworks, LangChain, Semantic Kernel, etc.) and still interoperate. The result is that intelligence becomes modular – one agent can seamlessly tap another’s expertise without custom integration code.

## Why A2A Matters for AI Agents

A2A unlocks the full power of generative AI in enterprises by **breaking silos** and enabling agents to combine their strengths. In practice, AI agents are being built with narrow specialties (booking flights, analyzing spreadsheets, checking compliance rules, etc.), and complex tasks often require invoking several agents in sequence. A2A means agents built by different teams or vendors can talk to each other out of the box.

Without such a standard, multi-agent workflows become brittle. As one example scenario illustrates, a customer support bot might need to “escalate” a technical issue: it has to connect with a diagnostic agent, which in turn must call a deployment agent. In the old approach each pair of agents would need a custom adapter. But that quickly becomes unmanageable. As one analysis put it, “Without a common communication standard, integrating these three agents is a complex, bespoke, and brittle process. Developers would need to write custom adapters and translation layers for each agent-pair interaction”. In contrast, with A2A the support agent simply calls `tasks/send` on the diagnostic agent with the needed data; the diagnostic agent processes it, then calls `tasks/send` on the deployment agent, and so on. Each agent only sees a well-defined protocol, not the internal logic of the others.

Key reasons A2A matters:

* **Interoperability:** Agents from different platforms (e.g. LangChain, Semantic Kernel, in-house tools) can work together. They no longer have to be locked in a single framework or cloud. Even large enterprise systems can be bridged: for example, Salesforce is collaborating with Google Cloud so their agentic systems can interoperate via A2A. In essence, A2A treats every agent as a standardized service with a JSON API, greatly expanding the pool of usable AI building blocks.
* **Complex workflows:** Many enterprise processes (onboarding, procurement, incident management) span multiple departments and systems. A2A lets agents delegate subtasks dynamically. A sales agent can ask a pricing agent for a quote, a legal agent to draft a contract, a supply-chain agent to reserve goods, and stitch the answers together – all via A2A calls. This enables the **composite AI systems** that can solve problems no single agent could.
* **Reduced integration cost:** By standardizing “how” agents talk, developers focus on **what** each agent does instead of glue code. If tomorrow there’s a new analytics agent, it can drop into the workflow without rewriting the entire pipeline. This lowers long-term maintenance and “technical debt.” A2A also future-proofs investments, since new agents and capabilities can join the ecosystem seamlessly.
* **Security and governance:** Using a unified protocol means enterprise IT can enforce policies uniformly (encryption, monitoring, identity). For example, every A2A call can be authenticated with the company’s identity system and logged centrally, avoiding the risk of shadow integrations. This built-in governance makes AI agents fit corporate compliance needs.

In sum, A2A turns agentic AI from siloed experiments into cohesive multi-agent applications. Enterprises get richer automation and innovation. Microsoft puts it simply: “They want their agents to orchestrate tasks that span vendors, clouds, and data silos. They want control, visibility, and trust—without being locked in”. A2A delivers on those enterprise requirements by making agent-to-agent dialogue structured, secure, and auditable.

## Real-World Examples of A2A Collaboration

A2A’s potential is clearest through examples of agent cooperation. Here are several scenarios illustrating how agents can combine efforts across domains:

* **Travel Planning:** A user asks their personal AI assistant to plan an international trip. The assistant (client agent) uses A2A to contact a flight-booking agent, a hotel-reservation agent, a local-tour agent, and a currency-conversion agent. Each agent returns structured information (itineraries, booking confirmations, exchange rates), which the assistant merges into a complete travel plan. A2A handles each handoff in JSON – the flight agent might reply with flight details as JSON data, the currency agent might reply with a number, etc. All results are synchronized under one “plan trip” task.
* **Candidate Sourcing (Hiring):** A hiring manager uses an AI recruiter agent to find software engineer candidates. The recruiter agent creates an A2A task and contacts specialized agents: a resume search agent, an interview scheduling agent, and a background-check agent. The resume agent replies with a list of profiles; the manager then tells the agent to schedule interviews via the scheduling agent. After interviews, the agent invokes the background-check agent. All steps happen automatically. This mirrors the example in Google’s announcement: “Within a unified interface… a user… tasks their agent to find candidates… The agent then interacts with other specialized agents to source potential candidates”.
* **Retail Supply Chain:** In a store’s stock management system, an **Inventory Agent** monitors incoming product data, and an **Order Agent** processes customer purchases. With A2A, the inventory agent can directly notify the order agent of low stock via a `tasks/send` call, and the order agent can ask an **Analytics Agent** for demand forecasts when needed. A Wipro reference architecture shows a LangGraph multi-agent system on Azure where inventory, order-processing, and analytics agents exchange updates (stock levels, orders, analytics results) over A2A. This creates a self-adjusting supply chain without writing custom connectors between each system.
* **IT / Customer Support:** A customer reports an issue through a support chat agent. The agent creates a task to diagnose the problem. It contacts a **Diagnostic Agent** (maybe specialized in the product) to analyze logs, then contacts a **Maintenance Agent** to schedule a fix. At each step, A2A messages carry context (user input, log files) and the agents reply with findings or actions. This way, support escalations become seamless. Without A2A, each support and diagnostic tool would require point-to-point scripts; with A2A, the standard protocol handles the flow.
* **Cross-Vendor Integration:** A2A also shines when mixing big-name agent ecosystems. For instance, Salesforce is working with Google Cloud to build agents that operate together using A2A. This means a Salesforce copilot agent could directly ask a Google agent for data (or vice versa) in one workflow – something that was impossible before without heavy engineering.

These examples show how **each agent stays focused on its expertise** while A2A handles the conversation. The protocol’s role is like a meeting room with a common language: each agent adds its piece of the puzzle into the task, and the client agent assembles the final solution.

## Comparison with Traditional Systems

A2A communication has important differences from conventional inter-process or service integration:

* **Synchronous vs Asynchronous:** Traditional APIs (REST/gRPC) usually assume quick request-response calls. Business processes, however, are often **asynchronous** and multi-step. A2A is “asynchronous by design,” natively supporting long-running tasks with streaming updates. Agents can pause, wait for input, and resume work. Conventional services might use workarounds (queues, callbacks), but A2A integrates these patterns into the protocol.
* **Stateful Workflows:** Typical microservices are stateless; each request stands alone. In contrast, A2A maintains a *Task* state that spans the conversation. Each agent remembers the task ID and can update or query its state. This allows agents to break complex jobs into parts (e.g. “Part 1: verify identity”, “Part 2: generate report”) without losing context.
* **Discovery and Flexibility:** Normally, one service must know the exact URL and interface of another. A2A’s Agent Cards provide discovery. Agents don’t need hard-coded endpoints; they can find partners by querying capabilities. The protocol is also modality-agnostic – unlike most APIs limited to fixed JSON schemas, A2A can carry text, images, forms, etc., negotiated on the fly. This makes it more flexible than standard request/response calls.
* **Integration Effort:** In legacy systems, connecting two applications often requires custom adapters or a centralized broker (ESB). For example, orchestrating a hiring process manually might involve writing glue code between HR software, scheduling tools, and email systems. A2A removes much of that work: once each function is wrapped as an agent, they automatically interoperate. There’s no need for a central orchestrator – the client agent itself can act as the conductor, delegating tasks via A2A messages.
* **Enterprise Concerns:** Regular web services need bolt-on security (e.g. an API gateway, IAM policies). A2A embeds security considerations from the start. As Google notes, A2A is built on “existing, popular standards” (HTTP, SSE, JSON-RPC) so it “is easier to integrate with existing IT stacks,” while also enforcing enterprise-grade auth and encryption. In traditional microservices, each team often needs to implement its own security and logging; A2A establishes a consistent model across all agents.

In short, A2A extends familiar integration patterns with agent-specific capabilities (task management, streaming, discovery). It treats AI agents more like networked teammates than standalone services. This shift is why many experts equate well-designed AI agent systems to *event-driven architectures*, where decoupling and real-time flows are the norm. With A2A, enterprises get the agility of microservices and the conversational power of AI together.

## Case Study: Automated Customer Onboarding

**Scenario:** A financial services firm is building an AI-driven system to automate the onboarding of new corporate clients. The process involves sales, compliance, legal, IT, and finance teams. Here’s how A2A can streamline this cross-department workflow:

1. **Initiate Onboarding Task:** A Sales Agent collects the client’s initial information and creates a new A2A task (`clientOnboarding`). The agent reads its Agent Card to ensure it has the appropriate permissions and then looks up a **Compliance Agent** via a registry or Agent Card directory.
2. **Identity & Credit Check:** The Sales Agent calls the Compliance Agent with `tasks/send`, attaching the client’s documents (e.g. company ID, financial statements). The Compliance Agent verifies identity and credit risk. It sends back status updates (e.g. “Document verified”, “Risk score: low”). Once done, it returns an artifact (“KYC report” PDF) attached to the task.
3. **Legal Contract Generation:** Seeing the KYC report is approved, the Sales Agent now contacts the **Legal Agent**. It sends the task ID and basic contract parameters. The Legal Agent drafts a service agreement (perhaps using a contract-generation LLM) and returns the signed contract as a file artifact in the task result.
4. **IT & Finance Setup:** Next, the Sales Agent invokes both an **IT Provisioning Agent** and a **Finance Agent** (possibly in parallel). The IT Agent receives the client’s user info and system requirements, then spins up accounts and sends credentials. The Finance Agent sets up billing by creating an invoice schedule in the company’s ERP. Each agent updates the task status: “IT: Provisioned (account: X)”, “Finance: Billing set for \$Y/month”.
5. **Monitoring and Human Oversight:** Throughout, A2A ensures all messages are logged and authenticated. If any step fails (e.g. incomplete information), the responsible agent returns an error code. The Sales Agent can either retry automatically or flag a human reviewer. These human agents can even participate by calling A2A tasks from a dashboard (since A2A has methods for human-in-the-loop).
6. **Completion:** When all parts are done, the Sales Agent sees the final task status as “completed” with all artifacts (KYC report, contract, account details). It notifies the customer that onboarding is finished. The entire workflow was handled by agent-to-agent calls, with no manual data handoffs.

This A2A-based system has several benefits: each functional team can maintain its own specialized agent without worrying about the rest of the chain. New teams (e.g. a Partner-Onboarding Agent) can join easily by providing an Agent Card. The company also gains full audit visibility – every agent interaction is recorded in the task log. In fact, Accenture reports building an “AI Refinery” platform where A2A-linked agents seamlessly share insights across domains. Our onboarding scenario is a concrete example of that vision: agents (sales, compliance, legal, IT, finance) worked together dynamically, transforming a complex multi-step process into an automated pipeline. The result: faster client onboarding, fewer errors, and the agility to update individual agent logic independently.

## Conclusion

The open A2A protocol is poised to be the backbone of enterprise-grade agentic AI. By defining **how** autonomous agents communicate – from task handoff to format negotiation – it turns ad-hoc bot projects into scalable, maintainable systems. For businesses, this means unlocking new levels of automation: workflows that once required extensive custom integration can now be built by composing standard agents. In the words of the A2A consortium, interoperability is no longer optional but essential for “fully realizing the potential of collaborative AI agents”. With major players like Google and Microsoft embracing A2A and industry partners like Salesforce on board, the ecosystem is rapidly aligning around this shared standard.

**Key takeaways for enterprise decision-makers:** A2A lets you mix and match AI services from different vendors and clouds, so you’re not locked in. It offloads integration to a standardized protocol, reducing development effort. It natively supports the asynchronous, multi-turn nature of business processes (from customer service to supply chains). And because it builds on HTTP/JSON with enterprise security, IT can govern it just like other web services. In short, A2A provides the language for AI agents to work as a team across your organization. Adopting it can dramatically accelerate the deployment of next-generation automation, while keeping systems secure and auditable.

## Annex: Technical Details

* **Agent Card (Discovery Profile):** Each agent advertises itself with a JSON *Agent Card*. This includes fields like `name`, `description`, `url` (the agent’s A2A endpoint), and `capabilities`. For example:

  ```json
  {
    "name": "GeoSpatial Route Planner Agent",
    "description": "Provides advanced route planning and traffic analysis services.",
    "url": "https://georoute-agent.example.com/a2a/v1",
    "provider": { "organization": "GeoServices Inc." },
    "version": "1.2.0",
    "capabilities": { "streaming": true, "pushNotifications": true },
    "authentication": {
      "schemes": ["OAuth2"],
      "credentials": "{\"authorizationUrl\": \"https://auth.example.com/authorize\", ...}"
    },
    "defaultInputModes": ["application/json","text/plain"],
    "defaultOutputModes": ["application/json","image/png"],
    "skills": [
      {
        "id": "route-optimizer-traffic",
        "name": "Traffic-Aware Route Optimizer",
        "description": "Calculates optimal routes considering real-time traffic.",
        "tags": ["routing","maps"],
        "inputModes": ["application/json","text/plain"],
        "outputModes": ["application/json"]
      }
      // Additional skills...
    ]
  }
  ```

  This card lets other agents know how to invoke the service (via its `url`), what authentication it requires, and what tasks it can perform.

* **JSON-RPC API Methods:** Agents implement a JSON-RPC 2.0 API at their `url`. The key methods include:

  * `tasks/send`: Start or continue a task. Parameters include a `Task` object (with fields like `id`, `message`, `user`). Returns a `Task` response when complete.
  * `tasks/sendSubscribe`: Like `send`, but responds via a streaming channel (SSE) with multiple updates (e.g. `TaskStatusUpdateEvent`, `TaskArtifactEvent`) until completion.
  * `tasks/get`: Retrieve the current state and history of a task by ID.
  * `tasks/cancel`: Request cancellation of a running task.
  * `tasks/pushNotification/set`: (Optional) Provide a webhook URL for asynchronous callbacks instead of polling.

  Example JSON-RPC call to start a task:

  ```json
  POST /a2a/v1/jsonrpc
  {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "tasks/send",
    "params": {
      "id": "task-001",
      "sessionId": "session-123",
      "message": {
        "parts": [
          {"contentType": "text/plain", "text": "Please analyze sales data for Q1."}
        ]
      }
    },
    "id": 100
  }
  ```

* **Message and Task Objects:** In A2A:

  * A **Task** object tracks the work. It has an `id`, `status` (e.g. `pending`, `running`, `completed`), and may include a `result` or `artifact` upon completion.
  * A **Message** contains one or more `parts`. Each part has a `contentType` (like `text/plain` or `application/json`) and the actual data. This lets agents exchange complex content (documents, data payloads, even images).
  * When a remote agent finishes a task, it returns a `Task` response with final outputs. If streaming, it sends intermediate `TaskStatusUpdate` events and final `TaskArtifactUpdate` events to the SSE stream.

* **Authentication & Transport:** All A2A communication must use HTTPS. Agents authenticate using standard web methods defined in the Agent Card (e.g. OAuth tokens or mutual TLS). The A2A spec recommends validating TLS certificates and aligning auth with enterprise identity services. Because agents often run as services, in practice each agent’s JSON-RPC endpoint is treated like any other secured web API.

These technical pieces form the foundation of an A2A system: Agent Cards for discovery, JSON-RPC calls for messaging, and defined data structures (`Task`, `Message`, etc.) for content. Developers building agents can use any language or framework that can send/receive JSON over HTTP. With these details in place, agents from any vendor can plug into each other’s workflows.
